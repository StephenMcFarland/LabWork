        {  
            // throw an object of user defined exception  
            throw new MyCustomException();  
        } 
              catch (MyCustomException ex)  
        {  
            System.out.println("Caught the exception");  
            System.out.println(ex.getMessage());  
        }

HashMap is faster, non-synchronized, 1 null key, accepts null values
HashTable is thread safe, no null values, older, synchronized
